Before the start of the semester, students need to fill out a preference order for the courses they wish to take. 
Not all students get all their preferred courses but the univeristy has to make sure that the majority of the students get their preferred courses.
It needs to follow an well defined algorithm so that the process of allocation becomes simplified.

Courses can be allotted by taking into consideration various factors such as :
  Time slot clash between courses that have already been alloted
  Maximum credit limit
  The completion of all the prerequisites of the said course
  If the course has already been registered
  If the capacity of the course has already been reached

This project is a small scale implementation of the course registration algorithm that ensures that courses get allotted to students in the most efficient way possible.
